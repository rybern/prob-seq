+ Migrate SHMM integration out of smol-minion into smol-shmm, leave a hole in shmm's interface for an inference engine
  shmm ---\
           ---> smol-shmm ---> smol-minion
  smol ---/
  smol-shmm can depend on smol and depend on smol and should implement
            posterior :: MatSeq s -> Emissions s -> Posterior
     or at least provide a new version of interface functions with SHMM integrated,
      maybe smol provides those interface functions with a low-level hole for SHMM

- Add tag tracking to buildMatSeq, constructor wrappers
